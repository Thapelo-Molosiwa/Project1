# LockedMe.com - File Management Application Prototype

## Project and Developer Details

- **Project Name:** LockedMe.com
- **Developer:** Thapelo Molosiwa
- **Objective:** To develop a prototype for LockedMe.com, a file management application, and present it to stakeholders for budget approval.

## Product Capabilities

The File Management Application aims to provide users with the ability to manage their files effectively via a command line interface. The core capabilities of the application include:

1. **File Retrieval:** Users can retrieve files in ascending order.
2. **File Management:** Users can add new files, delete existing files, and search for specific files.
3. **User Interface:** Command-line based interaction that allows easy navigation and execution of file operations.
4. **Error Handling:** Effective handling of user inputs and exceptions to ensure smooth operation.

## Appearance and User Interactions

### User Interface:

- **Welcome Screen:**
  - Displays the application name and developer details.
  - Provides options to:
    1. Retrieve current file names in ascending order.
    2. Add a file to the existing directory.
    3. Delete a user-specified file from the directory.
    4. Search for a user-specified file in the directory.
    5. Navigate back to the main context.
    6. Close the application.

### User Interactions:

- **Navigation:**
  - Users can navigate between different operations using command-line inputs.
  - Options to return to the main menu or exit the application.

- **Input Handling:**
  - Commands are entered via the command line.
  - Application validates inputs and provides appropriate feedback.

- **Feedback:**
  - Success messages upon completion of actions like adding or deleting a file.
  - Error messages for invalid inputs or operations, such as file not found.

## Core Concepts and Algorithms

### File Retrieval Algorithm:

- **Retrieve and Display Files:**
  - Retrieve the list of files from the specified directory.
  - Sort the list of files in ascending order by name.
  - Display the sorted list to the user.

### Add File Algorithm:

- **Add a New File:**
  - Take the file name input from the user.
  - Validate the file name for any illegal characters or formats.
  - Add the file to the directory if validation passes.
  - Provide feedback to the user about the success or failure of the operation.

### Delete File Algorithm:

- **Delete an Existing File:**
  - Take the file name input from the user.
  - Check if the file exists in the directory.
  - Delete the file if it exists and provide feedback.
  - Display an error message if the file does not exist.

### Search File Algorithm:

- **Search for a File:**
  - Take the file name input from the user.
  - Search the directory for the specified file name.
  - Display the search result to the user.
  - Provide feedback if the file is not found.

### Error Handling:

- Handle cases where the directory is empty or the specified file is not found.
- Validate user inputs to prevent errors such as invalid file names.
- Catch and handle exceptions to prevent application crashes.

- **Handle User Inputs and Exceptions:**
  - Implement input validation for file operations.
  - Develop exception handling mechanisms for different error scenarios.

### Sprint 3: Final Touches and Optimization

- **Refine User Interface:**
  - Improve the command-line interface for better user experience.
  - Ensure consistency and responsiveness across different operations.

- **Optimize Code:**
  - Review and optimize the code for performance.
  - Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Prepare Documentation:**
  - Create user documentation to guide users on how to use the application.
  - Prepare developer documentation to help future developers understand the codebase and contribute to the project.
